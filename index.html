    <h3>The City Changes</h3>
  
     <p>The city softens at night. Shadows stretch, streetlights hum, and windows glow like quiet beacons.</p>

     <p>Reflections shimmer on rain-slick pavement. The hum of distant traffic becomes a lullaby for those awake.</p>

      <li>Steam rising from subway grates</li>

<section>
    <h3>After Hours</h3>
     <p>The night does not hide the city. It reveals layers invisible in daylight. Every shadow, every light, every reflection becomes a story.</p>

     <p>Traffic slows, the air hums with quiet energy. Alleyways whisper of journeys begun and journeys paused. The city is both still and alive.</p>

     <p>When morning returns, it does not erase the night. It layers another narrative on top, but the echoes remain for those who listen.</p>
